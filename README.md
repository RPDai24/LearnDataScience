## 🚦 Getting Started
To run this project locally, follow these steps:
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RPDai24/codingTasks.git
   cd codingTasks
   
## 🚀 Usage
This repository is structured into four main folders, each targeting a specific learning track:
- [Tasks](https://github.com/RPDai24/codingTasks/tree/main/Tasks)
    - [01 - Python](https://github.com/RPDai24/codingTasks/tree/main/Tasks/01%20-%20Python)
    - [02 - Version Control](https://github.com/RPDai24/codingTasks/tree/main/Tasks/02%20-%20Version%20Control)
    - [03 - Data Visualization and Analysis](https://github.com/RPDai24/codingTasks/tree/main/Tasks/03%20-%20Data%20Visualization%20and%20Analysis)
    - [04 - Machine Learning](https://github.com/RPDai24/codingTasks/tree/main/Tasks/04%20-%20Machine%20Learning)

1. Navigate to the specific folder corresponding to the topic you want to explore.
2. Run the Python script or Jupyter notebook.
3. Experiment with the code: Modify the code as needed and run it to see the results. This is a great way to learn and understand the data analysis and Machine Learning implemented.
